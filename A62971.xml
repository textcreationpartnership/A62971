            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have little to add to what his Highneſs has expreſs'd in general terms, beſides laying before you the dangerous way you are at the preſent in, where Ruine or Infamy muſt inevitably attend you if you don't joyn with the PRINCE in the Common Cauſe, for the Defence of your Religion and Liberties; for ſhould it pleaſe God, for the Sins of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, to ſuffer your Arms to prevail, to what can you Victory ſerve you, but to enſlave you deeper, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the True Religion, in which you have liv'd, and your Fathers dy'd? Of which, I beg you, as a Friend, to conſider the Conſequences, and reflect on the Blot and Infamy it will bring on you, not only now, but in all After-ages, That by your means the Proteſtant Religion was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, and your Country depriv'd of its Ancient Liberties: and if it pleaſes God to bleſs the PRINCE's Endeavours with Succeſs, as I don't doubt but he will, conſider then what their Condition muſt be that oppoſe him in this ſo good a Deſign, where the greateſt Favour they can hope for, is their being ſuffer'd to end their days in Miſery and Want, deteſted and deſpiſed by all good men.</p>
            <p>It is therefore, and for many more reaſons too long to inſert here, that I as a true Engliſhman and your Friend, exhort you to joyn your Arms to the PRINCE for the Defence of the Common Cauſe, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and the Liberties of your Countrey; it is what I am well aſſured the major and beſt part of the Army, as well as the Nation, will do ſo ſoon as convenience is offered. Prevent them in ſo good an Action, whilſt it is in your power; and make it appear, That as the Kingdom hath always depended on the Navy for its defence, ſo you will yet go further by making it as much as in you lies, the Protection of her Religion and Liberties; and then you may aſſure your ſelves of all Marks of Favour and Honour ſuitable to the Merits of ſo good and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an Action. After this I ought not to add ſo inconſiderable a thing, as that it will for ever engage me to be in a moſt particular manner,</p>
